function p = bemf5_volume_field_potential(Points, c, P, t, Center, Area, normals, R, planeABCD, prec)
%   Computes electric potential for an array Points anywhere in space (line,
%   surface, volume). This field is due to surface charges at triangular
%   facets only. Includes accurate neighbor triangle integrals for
%   points located close to a charged surface.   
%   R is the dimensionles radius of the precise-integration sphere

%   R = is the local radius of precise integration in terms of average triangle size
